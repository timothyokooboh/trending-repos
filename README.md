### Technologies
```
1. Vue.js (Vue 3.0): I chose Vue 3.0 so that I could leverage the composition API to build well structured and modular components.

2. Tailwind CSS: The utility classes provided by Tailwind makes it faster to build cool user interfaces without leaving the template.

3. Jest: I used to Jest to write unit tests that focus on inputs and outputs such as props, DOM elements and API calls.
